This MATLAB codes simulates deterministic or randomized version of the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) model.
The random dynamics is based on the transport under location uncertainty. The ensuing model is referred to as SQG model under moderate uncertainty (SQG_MU).

This codes needs the MATLAB image processing toolbox.
Launch the script main.m to execute the algorithm.
Plots and MAT-files are saved each day of simulation in the folder images.

Several parameters can be changed easily in the beginning of the script main.m.
